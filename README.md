This is a project that allows the user to practice buying and selling cryptocurrencies. The user will be given $50000 
and will be able to add or subtract from that amount any time they would like. Your account will be shown in a user interface 
which will display the total asset value of your account as well as the assets you own.

Motivation: I wanted to do something using the web as I have never done any HTTP or websocket programming. In this 
project I have decided to use websockets to obtain live crypto data as it seemed the best choice for the task.
